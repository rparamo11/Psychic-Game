<!-- 2. You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, cd  Put the following text on your page: -->
<h1>Psychic-Game</h1>

<h2>Guess what letter I'm thinking of</h2>

<!-- 4. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly) -->

<!-- 5. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses) -->

<!-- 6. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update) -->

<!-- 7. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.) -->

<!-- 8. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page). -->

<!-- 9. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins). -->
